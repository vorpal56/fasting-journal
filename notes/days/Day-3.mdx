# Day 3, March 15, 2021

This day was a little bit better. I had slept for 12 hours, but I was just having insane problems getting out of bed. I didn't think much about food, and my hunger pains weren't as pronounced as the previous days, but I was really exhausted in the morning. I took 2500mcg of B12, some salt, and 4000 IU of vitamin D and I felt much better. Maybe this was a placebo effect, but I took a walk to not focus so much on food. I walked for 10251 steps to Connestoga mall to find some miso paste (didn't find any miso paste sadly), vitamins, and organic apple cider vinegar (to maybe suppress my hunger and induce some food bacteria for my gut). I planned to have some miso soup with little bits of tofu as one of my first meals for the [[Refeeding]] process (whenever that was). I watched TV for a couple of hours and then took a nap for about 1-2 hours. Productivity this day was pretty low, just took it slow and enjoyed my time not focusing on food. My hunger pains continued to not be a huge problem and I went to sleep regularly.
