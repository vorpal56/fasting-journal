Today feels like my regular days. I slept at 12am-ish and woke up at around 9am. During the night though and this morning, I had some itching on the same red areas described [[Day-6]]. The itching feeling (aka ["keto rash"](https://perfectketo.com/keto-rash/)) is noticeable but not unbearable. After doing some reading, it's not permanent or dangerous, but I will keep monitoring it and see how much further I can go without any food and supplements. Besides that, I did have a dream about [[Refeeding]] which was interesting. I had eaten some grapes and this like cheesy, starchy mixture and I actually tried to hide the food and plates that I used from my roommates. Maybe I was ashamed or embarassed that I wasn't going with I had planned and decided to "quit" earlier than I did. When I write about it now, there's nothing to be ashamed or embarassed about, I can look back and laugh at this ðŸ˜„.
