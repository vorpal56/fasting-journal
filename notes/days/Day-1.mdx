# Day 1
**March 13, 2021**
***

This day was very difficult, I had constant hunger pains, and the urge to quit immediately. Productivity was low and the only thing I can think about was food. This urge of hunger is driven by [[Ghrelin]], and I was trying my best to keep my mind busy. My body had been eating constantly since I was born, it never had enough time to heal itself. I had only walked for 2632 steps, and I wasn't fully out of energy, but I just didn't feel like walking as much today so I just came back home. Sleep was also difficult as going to bed hungry is an awful feeling. I just had to power through it and go to sleep.
