# Day 0, March 12, 2021

**Starting weight (prior to weight scale): 183-187lbs**

This is the day prior to my full commitment to an extended fast where I last had my meal at 8pm. I had intended to start on this day, but the hunger pains were immense and I wanted to use some of the food I had leftover to prevent it from spoiling. Days prior to this I had some Korean Fried Chicken since I just had the urge to have it. The leftovers after the chicken was finished was some sweet and spicy gochujang sauce with green onions, so I bought and boiled some frozen tteokbokki (rice cakes) and steamed 2 pork buns, with a side of leftover spinach and tomatoes. On this day I walked for 8829 steps to UW and looped back to an asian supermarket to buy the tteokbokki then went home. 

For about 10 days before day 0, I was doing [[OMAD]], but I just felt really hungry, and I don't think I was taking a good approach to it. I ate more "healthier" cooked meals like chickpea or chicken curry with brown rice, and spinach or broccoli or yu-choy. I had some hummus-pesto "pizza" with spinach, pickled onions, and peppers on flatbread/naan on other meals, but that's about it.
