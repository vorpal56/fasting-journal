# Day 2, March 14, 2021

This day was just as difficult as [[Day-1]] where I still had hunger pains and the urges to quit were immense. I had slept for about 8 hours. Productivity was also low and again, the only thing I could think about was food. Energy levels were low, but I felt the urge to move myself to try and forget about the hunger pains. I walked 9419 steps around the park near UW and Laurier and I didn't feel as much out of energy. I had done some school work and was feeling okay, but still drained. My friends went on the nearby field to walk for a bit, and I thought I should get my 10000 steps in and so I walked with them for another 1784 steps, totaling 11203 steps for the entire day. Sleeping on an empty stomach again was very difficult and I had to just to close my eyes and go to sleep.
