This day was much better. I didn't wake up very hungry, I slept for a good 10-11 hours, but I got up at around 11:30am. My productivity is much higher today, I did my outstanding school work and all the journaling for days 0-4, so my recollection of events during that time is not as precise starting today. I walked for 6655 steps to get a weight scale and some magnesium supplements. I was also looking for potassium, zinc, iron, and calcium (the general electrolytes just in case), but I wanted to see how much longer I can go without having the need for supplements. After my walk, I watched a couple of videos to relax. I haven't played as much video games as I usually do, from upwards of 10+ hours to only 1-2 hours a day which is huge progress for me. I have been feeling a little bit hungry, but not this insatiable hunger where there are prolonged feelings of pain. I just drank some water, no apple cider vinegar, no salt, and no supplements today. At the end of the day, I just continued to write the different pages for this journal. 

I listened a bit to a [podcast about extended fasting from Rich Roll and Dr. Alan Goldhamer](https://youtu.be/yaWVflQolmM). What I learned was that the social aspects around food are very different from say, alcohol, smoking, or drug addiction. When you find someone who's alcoholic, you tell them to not be an acoholic you stop drinking. The same goes with smoking and drug addiction. It doesn't help to tell someone that, nor does it help to tell them that you should drink or smoke twice a week; they'll continue craving and craving, which is the opposite of the goal. When you have someone who's obese and you tell them that you're not going to eat, everyone's going to absolutely crazy! Those are similar in prospect and we need to find strategies that tackle the root of the problem and the social aspect garnering it is difficult to traverse. This is why I find journaling to be helpful for accountability and motivation while [[Fasting]] as one of processes our body does naturally to use up excess stores of energy through fat.
