**Starting weight: Not measured**

**Ending weight: 178.6lbs**

This day was much better. I didn't wake up very hungry, I slept for a good 10-11 hours, but I got up at around 11:30am. My productivity is much higher today, I did my outstanding school work and all the journaling for days 0-4, so my recollection of events during that time is not as precise starting today. I walked for 6655 steps to get a weight scale and some magnesium supplements. I was also looking for potassium, zinc, iron, and calcium (the general electrolytes just in case), but I wanted to see how much longer I can go without having the need for supplements. After my walk, I watched a couple of videos to relax. I haven't played as much video games as I usually do, from upwards of 10+ hours to only 1-2 hours a day which is huge progress for me. I have been feeling a little bit hungry, but not this insatiable hunger where there are prolonged feelings of pain. I just drank some water, no apple cider vinegar, no salt, and no supplements today. At the end of the day, I just continued to write the different pages for this journal. 

I listened a bit to a [podcast about extended fasting from Rich Roll and Dr. Alan Goldhamer](https://youtu.be/yaWVflQolmM). What I learned was that the social aspects around food are very different from say, alcohol or smoking. When you find someone who's alcoholic, you can tell them to stop drinking, but what good is that going to do? You can also tell them that it's "ok" to drink alcohol on some days and not other days, but how effective is that going to be? When you're someone who's obese and you tell them that you're not going to eat, your friends will say that you're absolutely crazy! Those are similar in prospect and we need to find strategies that tackle the root of the problem, and [[Fasting]] is one of the most natural processes our body does to use excess stores of energy.
