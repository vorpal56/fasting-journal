# Day 4, March 16, 2021

This day wasn't as difficult, but I experienced some [[Insomnia]]. I had slept for about 12 hours on the night of day 2 and had a nap for another 2 hours, and on the night of day 3, I went to bed at 2am and woke up at 7:30am. I didn't get out of bed until 11am. I had walked for 4527 steps to the asian supermarket to get some organic miso paste for my [[Refeeding]] and I found some decadent peanut butter buns for me to eat sometime after my fast is complete. I had a call for some catching up which helped me forget about my hunger urges. My productivity was again low, I had planned to do some studying and catching up for school, but I just didn't do that. I did some troubleshooting for one of my projects, but that's about it. My hunger throughout the day was pretty strong, so I had a few pinches of salt and I used 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar diluted with water to hopefully suppress my hunger slightly. I didn't find much success with the hunger suppression, but the salt tasted really good, not so much the apple cider vinegar. I was out of energy by about 8pm and just went on my phone to watch some more fasting videos until 12am and during this period I found hunger cues to be very strong, but not like it was in on the first or second day.
