# Why I Started Fasting

For pretty much my entire life, I have been skinny fat, and I wanted to do something about it. I had asked the question, **"how do you lose fat", not just [[Weight]]**. I had adopted the "eat less, move more" mentality over my highschool years since that was what mainstream fitness media told me to do, but I was never able to stick with it.

After highschool, I went to university and in the first year, it was mandatory for us to have a meal plan. This was buffet-style, which included a wide range of American-like foods including french fries, pizza, burgers, hash browns, cereal, ice cream, muffins. It had a lot of decadent food options, ones that **gave you what you wanted, not what you needed**. I brought home lots of these to snack on back home, which grew my unhealthy eating habits and my urge to constantly eat.

In my second year, I had challenged myself to exercise more and first learned about the idea of [[Fasting]]. During this period I had went from 180lbs to 150-155lbs in about 4-6 months, adopting an [[OMAD]] protocol revolving around a [[Whole-Foods-Plant-Based]] diet. This took me by surprise because I didn't even realize I was doing this, it was just part of my routine. I knew I was eating healthier foods, but I didn't know that I wasn't eating throughout the entire day. I wish I had documented it when first did this, but that's why I'm doing it now. I regained all of my weight back and more because I had eaten garbage food over my co-op and I didn't take care of my body. I had indulged with my Mom, and in January 2021, I was my heaviest at 197lbs.

Later in March 2021, this is when I said enough is enough and I was committed to adopting an extended fast. This is when I started [[Day-0]].
