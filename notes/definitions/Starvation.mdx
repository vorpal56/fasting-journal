# What is Starvation?

Starvation is different than [[Fasting]]. It's the **involuntary** abstinence food. This happens beyond the fasting period which is when you've used almost all of your fat stores and sources of food are little to none. This means that there is absolutely no food around anywhere, no grocery stores, no convenience stores, just **no accessible sources of food**. This is where the body starts shutting down and the risk of death is much higher.
