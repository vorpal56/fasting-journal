Refeeding is the process of reintroducing food to the system after a fasting period. It dictates how we handle the refeeding. As the length of the fast increases, refeeding becomes just as crucial as the fast itself. Our stomachs become smaller and smaller the longer the fasting period and the more sensitive it is to changes to food. This can especially affect our [[Gut-Microbiome]] and the effects of [[Insulin]]. Taking a safe approach to refeeding doesn't put our body in to shock and dismiss all the hard work that was done.

There's a lot of weird and counterintuitive information out there on refeeding, but the most informative video that I've found is from Dorian Wilson, called [How to Break a Fast: Best Results & Worst Mistakes](https://youtu.be/h3L_118IIgE). **TL;DW** of it is to avoid highly processed foods, which usually contain lots of refined sugar and spike [[Insulin]] or sodium. Since protein and fat doesn't increase insulin as much as carbohydrates, it can be good to incorporate a combination of protein and fat with low carbohydrates. Since my plan is to readopt a [[Whole-Foods-Plant-Based]] diet, I'm going to do make some green juices (some green vegetable + water), then some miso soup with tofu. I will continue this until I can introduce more solid foods like fruits with high water content (asian pear, grapes, watermelon) and raw/fermented/pickled vegetables including kimchi, miso, sauerkraut, and keffer, to promote a good [[Gut-Microbiome]].
