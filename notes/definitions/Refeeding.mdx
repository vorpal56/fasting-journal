Refeeding is the process of reintroducing food to the body after a fasting period. What's important is how we handle the refeeding. As the length of the fast increases, refeeding can become just as crucial as the fast itself. Our stomachs become smaller and smaller the longer the fasting period and it also becomes more sensitive when reintroduced to food. And as the fasting period increases, the more risk there is of **refeeding syndrome**:  imbalances of electrolytes. This can cause increased blood pressure, possible seizures, paralysis, cardiac arrest, and overall **significantly increase the risk of death if we don't take a safe approach in doing so** [^1]. Refeeding in general can especially affect our [[Gut-Microbiome]] and the effects of [[Insulin]]. Taking a safe approach to refeeding is, what I believe, **more important than the fast itself**. 

There's a lot of weird and counterintuitive information out there on refeeding, but the most informative video that I've found is from Dorian Wilson, called [How to Break a Fast: Best Results & Worst Mistakes](https://youtu.be/h3L_118IIgE). **TL;DW avoid highly processed foods**, which usually contain lots of refined sugar (spiking [[Insulin]] drastically) or sodium. Since protein and fat doesn't increase insulin as much as carbohydrates, it can be good to incorporate a combination of protein and fat with low carbohydrates since our body has been fat adapted. Shifting the macronutrients from fat to carbohydrates is also a slow process, so consider this if you decide to have higher carbohydrates.

# What am I going to be doing?
I will be planning to take **atleast 1/2 number of days from fasting to refeed slowly**. For example if I fasted for 10 days, refeeding would be at minimum 5 days. Since my plan is to readopt a [[Whole-Foods-Plant-Based]] diet, I'm going to make some green juices (some green vegetable, water, and maybe a fruit), then some miso soup with tofu. I will continue this and increase the volumne until I can introduce more solid foods like fruits with high water content (asian pear, grapes, watermelon) and raw/fermented/pickled vegetables including kimchi, miso, and sauerkraut/blaukraut, to promote a good [[Gut-Microbiome]].
