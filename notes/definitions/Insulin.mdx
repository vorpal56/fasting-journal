Insulin is the hormone that regulates the storage of the food that we eat. Some of the energy is stored as [[Glycogen]] and the other as fat. Higher insulin, whether from injection of insulin or insulin resistance, promotes weight gain and prevents us from accessing our fat for energy [^1]. So when we regulate insulin, we increase our [[Counter-Regulatory-Hormones]] and we're able to more easily access fat for energy which is what we're aiming for.
