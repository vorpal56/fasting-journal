# Weight vs. Fat

Weight loss is not synonymous with fat loss. Weight does include fat, but it also includes other parts of the body such as skin, connective tissue, muscle, and water. It is important to make this distinction because weight can stay the same, but you can lose the parts of your body that are extremely valuable. For example, you can lose 5lbs of muscle and gain 5lbs of fat and your weight would stay the same. But on the opposite side, you can gain 5lbs of muscle and lose 5lbs of fat which is much better than the former.
