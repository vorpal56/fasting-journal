OMAD stands for one meal a day, and it generally is a 20:4 split (20 hours of fasting and 4 hours of feeding) or 23:1 split (23 hours of fasting and 1 hour of feeding). This is a more aggressive approach than the 16:8 split since you're fasting for a much longer period of time. The benefits grow the longer the fasting period, but this can be more difficult mentally and physically.
