Insomnia makes it hard to sleep. Some nights you wake up too early or wake up too often. It can make us feel tired when we wake up. When we're sleeping, we're [[Fasting]] and it kind of brings up the energy into our body making us not feel very tired through our [[Basal-Metabolic-Rate]]. This can be through other means such as stress or anxiety, but fasting is a big component [^1].
