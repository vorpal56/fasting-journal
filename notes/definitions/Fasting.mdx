# What is Fasting?

Fasting is the **voluntary** abstinence of food, which is different than [[Starvation]]. There are two different states the body can be in and it's one or the other, not both:
1. A fasted state
2. A fed state

When you're in a fasted state, the body uses the stored energy within the body, first being [[Glycogen]] and then fat after all glycogen and glucose is used up. While in the fed state, your body uses the readily available glucose from food that's eaten. When we eat, [[Insulin]] goes up and excess calories that can't be stored as glycogen, is stored as fat.

Fasting is much more powerful than the "eat less, move more" approach since it doesn't reduce your [[Basal-Metabolic-Rate]], but instead increases it. It also allows our body to tap into the fat stores that we've accumulated, which is what the main purpose of fat is: energy stores when there isn't any food around.

**Our bodies are amazing and complicated**, so complicated that even medical professionals have completely different approaches in handling health. What's so interesting is that our body is not stupid and most of the time, our body naturally goes through it's self-healing. When we have say an itch on our body, what does our parents or doctors tell us? To not scratch it! When we don't interfere with our normal bodily functions, it does wonders in repairing itself. Fasting revolves around the idea of **doing absolutely nothing**. Don't have money? You can fast. Don't have time? You can still fast. Don't like cooking? Fasting is still possible. Don't like cleaning? You can still fast!
