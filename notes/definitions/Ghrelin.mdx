Ghrelin is colloquially known as the "hunger hormone", it's a hormone that tells our brain that we're hungry and we need to find food. It increases our appetite, bringing us to overeat and consume more calories than energy expenditure from our [[Basal-Metabolic-Rate]] and exercise, making us store fat. As ghrelin increases, hunger becomes more difficult to handle, and you feel this "pain" that feels like it's impossible to control. The better we control ghrelin, the better our fat loss [^1].
