Sustainability is different than environmental sustainability which is what we usually think about and is always important, but given the context of this journal, it asks the question: "can I do this for a long period of time **without** negative effects to the way I maintain relationships (food or otherwise), mood, work, money, exercise, hobbies, and others?" If the answer is no, then it's not sustainable and we need to find alternatives, adjust, or stop completely. If the answer is yes however, then we can incrementally make adjustments or keep it as is. Consistency and sustainability go hand-in-hand, they're both important aspects of keeping a balanced life and making the progress we're looking for. If I find that it's more sustainable to have 80% whole foods and 20% snacks and other goodies than it is to be 100% [[Whole-Foods-Plant-Based]], that's okay. As we continuously progress, we can try moving up or stay as is.
