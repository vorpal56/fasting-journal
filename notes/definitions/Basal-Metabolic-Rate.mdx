# What is Basal Metabolic Rate?

Basal metabolic rate (also known as metabolism) is the amount of energy expended for just existing. Some examples of this include breathing, sleeping, moving our body (and even not moving our body), pumping blood throughout our body, recycling cells, and the list goes on [^1]. When we're [[Fasting]], our BMR actually increases since its focus is on providing more energy to our body to go and find food. If it were to go down, we wouldn't have enough energy to go and find food, which accelerates our body in shutting down, and our body is not stupid enough to do that. If it were to continuously decrease, we can see the vicious cycle of decreased energy, decreased likelihood of finding food, leading to increased risk of death [^2].
