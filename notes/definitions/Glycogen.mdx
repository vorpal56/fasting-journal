Glycogen is an energy storage mechanism when we've expended through our glucose. It can be stored in our muscles and liver, and it provides energy for up 18 hours (there's conflicting evidence about the length since, my guess is that, every person is different). This is the layer before we start burning fat so we want to burn through all of our glucose, then glycogen, then start tapping into our fat.
