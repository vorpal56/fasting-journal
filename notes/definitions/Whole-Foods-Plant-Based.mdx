# Whole Foods Plant Based vs. Veganism

Whole Foods Plant Based is a diet focused around low processed natural foods including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, seeds and nuts. It's more so centered around health compared to veganism. Veganism on the otherhand is the abstinence of animal products and promotes a philosophy of avoiding the use of animals for food, commodities, work, hunting, and other sources of exploitation. One important part I find is that you can be an unhealthy vegan. For example, Oreos are vegan, and I can eat that my entire life and consider myself vegan, but in no way is it healthy. Both the philosophy of veganism and the health promoting benefits of a whole foods plant based diet is what I believe to be optimal.
