What I learned was that the social aspects around food are very different from say, alcohol, smoking, or drug addiction. When you find someone who's alcoholic, you tell them to not be an acoholic you stop drinking. The same goes with smoking and drug addiction. It doesn't help to tell someone that, nor does it help to tell them that you should drink or smoke twice a week; they'll continue craving and craving, which is the opposite of the goal. When you have someone who's obese and you tell them that you're not going to eat, everyone's going to absolutely crazy!
