I walked for 6655 steps to get a weight scale and some magnesium supplements. I was also looking for potassium, zinc, iron, and calcium (the general electrolytes just in case), but I wanted to see how much longer I can go without having the need for supplements. After my walk, I watched a couple of videos to relax. I haven't played as much video games as I usually do, from upwards of 10+ hours to only 1-2 hours a day which is huge progress for me. I have been feeling a little bit hungry, but not this insatiable hunger where there are prolonged feelings of pain. I just drank some water, no apple cider vinegar, no salt, and no supplements today.

What I learned was that the social aspects around food are very different from say, alcohol, smoking, or drug addiction. When you find someone who's alcoholic, you tell them to not be an acoholic you stop drinking. The same goes with smoking and drug addiction. It doesn't help to tell someone that, nor does it help to tell them that you should drink or smoke twice a week; they'll continue craving and craving, which is the opposite of the goal. When you have someone who's obese and you tell them that you're not going to eat, everyone's going to absolutely crazy!
